# useful-functions
The purpose of this repository is to save or store useful functions that could be reused for different applications or different parts within one application. The first file, helper.js was built or constructed to be completed dynamic. Previously it had harcoded values like const casestudies = document.querySelector('[href="casestudies.php"]');  which has been replaced with const casestudies = document.querySelector("[href=" + CSS.escape(lastsegment) + "]");.
It wouldn't require you to go into the code and change the values manually because the values change in relation to the url.
